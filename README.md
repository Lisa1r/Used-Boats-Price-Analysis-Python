# Used-Boats-Price-Analysis-Python
This is a Python data analysis project carried out within the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program in January 2023.
## Objective
The project centers upon a European used boats dealer listing their boats for sale on their own website. A comprehensive inventory analysis has been carried out to determine what are the key factors that influence the price of boats. The final objective of the project is to provide the used boats dealer with the necessary information to be able to correctly price boats, and thus optimize costs and increase profits.
## Data
The [data set used](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karthikbhandary2/boat-sales) was downloaded from Kaggle.
## Results
After carrying out regression and cluster analyses, it was determined that:
- Boat age is the key factor that influences the price, i.e. the newer the boat, the higher the price
- Boat length and number of views (online listing) play a minor role in determining a boat's price
